 Fun fact: I've been dreaming about a tattoo for several years. Last week I went to a tattoo studio and had two tattoos done. The funny thing is that I always have trouble with changes in my life, so I spent the next two days lamenting, regretting and trying to find a way to remove my two unfortunate tattoos. But as it comes to expanding your comfort zone limits, after two days I got used to the changes and now I love my tattoos :)
